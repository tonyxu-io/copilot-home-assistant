# Calendly Management

Hybrid skill for Calendly. Prefer API for reads, supported CRUD, webhook setup, and sync. Prefer Playwright for UI-only settings like payment, booking page customization, and plan-gated areas.

## Current User Context

- Public page: `https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}`
- Existing free event: `https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/free-consultation`
- Connected integrations observed in UI:
  - Google Calendar (primary + secondary Google accounts)
  - Google Meet
  - Zoom
  - Stripe
- Default observed schedule: daily `9:00 AM – 5:00 PM` CT
- Paid consults created live in UI:
  - `https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/quick-consult`
  - `https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/deep-dive`
  - `https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/strategy-session`

## Operating Principle

1. **API first** for discovery, syncing, and supported event CRUD.
2. **Playwright second** for payment, booking-page options, invitee questions, confirmation settings, and any editor path that the API does not cover.
3. **Verify public links last** by checking the event list plus the live public page.

## Authentication

### Personal Access Token (PAT)
Use PAT for internal / single-account automation.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

Best for {{PARENT_1}}-only automation, cron jobs, and internal assistant skills.

### OAuth 2.1
Use OAuth for public / multi-user apps.

- Authorization endpoint: `https://auth.calendly.com/oauth/authorize`
- Token endpoint: `https://auth.calendly.com/oauth/token`
- Request the minimum scopes needed; new tokens are scope-gated.

### Scope map (official)
From `https://developer.calendly.com/scopes`:

- `users:read` → `GET /users/me`, `GET /users/{uuid}`
- `event_types:read` → `GET /event_types`, `GET /event_types/{uuid}`, `GET /event_type_available_times`
- `event_types:write` → `POST /event_types`, `PATCH /event_types/{uuid}`, `POST /one_off_event_types`
- `availability:read` → `GET /user_busy_times`, `GET /user_availability_schedules`
- `scheduled_events:read` → `GET /scheduled_events`, invitee reads
- `webhooks:read` / `webhooks:write` → webhook subscription reads/writes
- `routing_forms:read` → routing form reads
- `shares:write` / `scheduling_links:write` → single-use scheduling links

## API Base + Conventions

- REST base: `https://api.calendly.com`
- Official docs root: `https://developer.calendly.com/api-docs`
- API guide: `https://developer.calendly.com/getting-started/`
- Use **v2 only**
- Calendly commonly expects full resource URIs, not bare UUIDs
- Start every integration with `GET /users/me`

### Canonical bootstrap flow

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/users/me \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

Representative response pattern:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "uri": "https://api.calendly.com/users/USER_UUID",
    "name": "{{PARENT_1_FULL_NAME}}",
    "slug": "{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}",
    "email": "{{EMAIL}}",
    "scheduling_url": "https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}",
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "organization": "https://api.calendly.com/organizations/ORG_UUID"
  }
}
```

Store `resource.uri` and `resource.organization` immediately.

## Key REST API Endpoints

### Identity

```http
GET /users/me
GET /users/{uuid}
GET /organization_memberships
```

### Event types

```http
GET /event_types
GET /event_types/{uuid}
POST /event_types
PATCH /event_types/{uuid}
GET /event_type_available_times
POST /one_off_event_types
POST /shares
POST /scheduling_links
```

### Scheduled events / bookings

```http
GET /scheduled_events
GET /scheduled_events/{uuid}
GET /scheduled_events/{uuid}/invitees
GET /scheduled_events/{uuid}/invitees/{invitee_uuid}
POST /invitees
POST /scheduled_events/{uuid}/cancellation
```

### Availability

```http
GET /user_availability_schedules
GET /user_busy_times
GET /event_type_availability_schedules
PATCH /event_type_availability_schedules/{uuid}
```

### Routing

```http
GET /routing_forms
GET /routing_forms/{uuid}
GET /routing_form_submissions
```

### Webhooks

```http
POST /webhook_subscriptions
GET /webhook_subscriptions
GET /webhook_subscriptions/{uuid}
DELETE /webhook_subscriptions/{uuid}
GET /webhook_subscriptions/sample_data
```

## Exact API Request / Response Patterns

> These are the practical patterns to use in agents. Calendly's JS-heavy reference UI sometimes hides the raw examples, so keep the official docs links nearby and verify if fields drift.

### 1) List event types for the current user

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/event_types?user=https://api.calendly.com/users/USER_UUID&active=true' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "collection": [
    {
      "uri": "https://api.calendly.com/event_types/EVENT_UUID",
      "name": "Quick Consult",
      "slug": "quick-consult",
      "active": true,
      "duration": 30,
      "booking_uri": "https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/quick-consult",
      "kind": "solo"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "count": 1,
    "next_page": null
  }
}
```

### 2) Create a one-on-one event type shell

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/event_types \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "event_type": {
      "name": "Quick Consult",
      "description": "30-minute paid consult.",
      "slug": "quick-consult",
      "duration": 30,
      "active": true,
      "profile": "https://api.calendly.com/profiles/PROFILE_UUID"
    }
  }'
```

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "uri": "https://api.calendly.com/event_types/NEW_EVENT_UUID",
    "name": "Quick Consult",
    "slug": "quick-consult",
    "active": true,
    "duration": 30,
    "booking_uri": "https://calendly.com/{{GITHUB_USERNAME}}/quick-consult"
  }
}
```

### 3) Patch an existing event type

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/event_types/EVENT_UUID \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "event_type": {
      "name": "Deep Dive",
      "slug": "deep-dive",
      "description": "60-minute strategy session."
    }
  }'
```

Use API patch for name/description/slug when supported, then use the UI for payment and booking-page controls.

### 4) Event type available times

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.calendly.com/event_type_available_times?event_type=https://api.calendly.com/event_types/EVENT_UUID&start_time=2026-05-12T00:00:00Z&end_time=2026-05-18T00:00:00Z' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

Official constraint from Calendly docs: `start_time` and `end_time` must be future dates and the range cannot exceed 7 days.

### 5) Webhook subscription

Official guide: `https://developer.calendly.com/receive-data-from-scheduled-events-in-real-time-with-webhook-subscriptions`

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "url": "https://your-domain.com/api/calendly/webhook",
    "events": ["invitee.created", "invitee.canceled"],
    "organization": "https://api.calendly.com/organizations/ORG_UUID",
    "scope": "organization"
  }'
```

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "uri": "https://api.calendly.com/webhook_subscriptions/WEBHOOK_UUID",
    "callback_url": "https://your-domain.com/api/calendly/webhook",
    "events": ["invitee.created", "invitee.canceled"],
    "scope": "organization",
    "state": "active"
  }
}
```

### 6) Invitee details follow-up after webhook

Official webhook guide says to use the invitee URI from the webhook payload and then call the invitee endpoint for richer data (email, name, answers to questions).

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.calendly.com/scheduled_events/EVENT_UUID/invitees/INVITEE_UUID \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```

### 7) Reschedule webhook semantics

Official guide: `https://developer.calendly.com/see-how-webhook-payloads-change-when-invitees-reschedule-events`

- Reschedules trigger **both** `invitee.canceled` and `invitee.created`
- The canceled payload has `rescheduled: true`
- The new invitee payload is the active booking
- Old/new invitee URI references live on the invitee model, not the event model

## Event Type API Reality Check

Calendly exposes event-type creation and updates in v2, but it is still not full parity with the editor.

### Safe assumptions
- API is good for list/read/create/patch of basic event types
- API is good for availability reads and webhook-driven sync
- API is **not** the primary path for Stripe payment configuration
- API coverage for advanced editor features can lag the UI

### Safe hybrid pattern
1. API creates the one-on-one shell event type
2. Playwright opens the editor and finishes advanced settings
3. API/webhooks monitor bookings after launch

## Live Playwright Navigation Map (Observed)

### Core app navigation
- Scheduling
- AI Assistant
- Meetings
- Recaps
- Availability
- Contacts
- Workflows
- Sell
- Integrations & apps
- Routing
- Analytics
- Admin center

### Scheduling page
- URL: `https://calendly.com/app/scheduling/meeting_types/user/me`
- Sub-tabs observed:
  - Event types
  - Single-use links
  - Meeting polls
- Event cards expose:
  - `Copy link`
  - `View live page`
  - `{Event Name} settings`

### Availability pages
- Schedules: `https://calendly.com/app/availability/schedules`
- Calendar settings: `https://calendly.com/app/availability/calendar_settings`
- Direct navigation to `https://calendly.com/app/availability/advanced_settings` returned 404 during this session; verify live before automating.

### Integrations
- `https://calendly.com/integrations`
- Stripe edit page: `https://calendly.com/integrations/stripe/edit`
- Connected items observed: Zoom, Google Meet, Google Calendar, Stripe

### Meetings
- `https://calendly.com/app/meetings/user/me`
- Useful for exports, manual review, and post-booking spot checks

### Routing
- `https://calendly.com/app/routing/forms/user/me`
- `New routing form` was disabled in this session; treat routing as plan/permission-sensitive

## Working Playwright Selectors and Structures

### Event list / cards
- Event list URL: `https://calendly.com/app/scheduling/meeting_types/user/me`
- Settings button pattern: `button[aria-label="Quick Consult settings"]`
- Public link buttons observed as visible text: `Copy link`, `View live page`

### Create flow
- Entry action: `Create new event type`
- Template button text: `One-on-one`
- Draft title field: `textarea[name="name"]`
- Duration button: `#duration-button`
- Duration combobox: `select[name="eventDuration"]` or combobox with `name="eventDuration"`
- Custom duration input: `input[name="customEventDuration"]`
- Custom duration unit: combobox `name="customEventDurationType"`
- Location step commonly used Zoom in the initial editor
- Creation footer button text: `Create`

### Event editor
- Read/display title area: `#event-name-field`
- Editable title field after activating rename: `textarea[name="name"]`
- More options section reveals advanced panels below

### Booking page options
- Panel container: `[data-testid="bookingPageOptions-panel-content-container"]`
- Slug input: `input[name="slug"]`

### Payment
- Panel container: `[data-testid="payment-panel-content-container"]`
- Toggle: `input[name="paymentSwitch"]`
- Amount field: `#payment-amount-field`
- Alternate amount locator seen in DOM: `input[placeholder="0.00"]`
- Processor area text referenced Stripe when connected

### Duration summary
- Panel container: `[data-testid="duration-panel-content-container"]`
- Final saved summary can normalize custom input into `3 hr`, `1 hr`, etc.

## Step-by-Step Playwright Patterns That Worked

### Pattern A — create a new paid one-on-one event
1. Go to `Scheduling` → `Event types`
2. Click `Create new event type`
3. Choose `One-on-one`
4. Fill `textarea[name="name"]`
5. Set duration from `#duration-button` / duration combobox
6. Choose `Zoom` as location
7. Click `Create`
8. If the initial title sticks awkwardly (for example `New MeetingQuick Consult`), rename immediately in the editor
9. Open `More options`
10. Expand `Booking page options` and set `input[name="slug"]`
11. Expand `Payment`, enable `input[name="paymentSwitch"]`, then set `#payment-amount-field`
12. Wait for the amount summary to reflect `$500.00 USD` or the target amount
13. Return to the Scheduling list and confirm the card shows `Copy link`

### Pattern B — edit an existing event
1. From the Scheduling list, open `{Event Name} settings`
2. Use `Edit`
3. If the editor initially shows summary blocks only, click into the specific section again to force the real inputs to mount
4. For slug/payment work, always use `More options`
5. Save, then re-open once to confirm the field persisted

### Pattern C — duplicate to create a variant fast
1. Open `{Event Name} settings`
2. Choose `Duplicate`
3. Open the duplicate editor
4. Rename the event
5. Change duration / slug / amount
6. Return to Scheduling
7. If the new card shows `Turn On`, activate it before sharing the public link

### Pattern D — activate an off event after duplication
1. Open the duplicated card's settings menu
2. Use `Turn On`
3. Re-check the card for `Copy link`
4. Do not announce the link live until `Copy link` is visible

## Stripe Payment Setup via UI

### Known-good flow
1. Confirm Stripe is already connected at `https://calendly.com/integrations/stripe/edit`
2. Open the event editor
3. Go to `More options` → `Payment`
4. Enable `input[name="paymentSwitch"]`
5. Use `#payment-amount-field` to set the amount
6. Confirm Stripe remains the processor and the amount sticks after blur/save
7. Verify via editor summary or public preview that the event now shows the price in USD

### Known-good amounts used live
- Quick Consult → `500.00`
- Deep Dive → `900.00`
- Strategy Session → `2,500.00`

## Gotchas, Wait Patterns, and Reliable Workarounds

### UI gotchas
- Regular Playwright `click()` often gets intercepted by overlays, sticky headers, or collapsed panels
- `fill()` can fail on React-controlled inputs even when the field looks editable
- Some panels look visually expanded while their actual inputs are still unmounted
- Duplicated events may land in an off/draft-like state until explicitly turned on
- Re-opening `More options` can switch the editor between summary and fully editable states

### Wait patterns
- After opening `More options`, wait for the specific panel container instead of generic page idle
- After toggling payment, wait for `#payment-amount-field` to exist before typing
- After changing slug or amount, blur the field and re-read the value from the DOM
- After turning an event on, wait for the Scheduling list card to show `Copy link`

### Reliable DOM forcing technique
When normal `fill()` does not persist, use the native input setter and dispatch events:

```js
(el, value) => {
  const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(el)
  const setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(proto, 'value').set
  setter.call(el, value)
  el.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', { bubbles: true }))
  el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', { bubbles: true }))
}
```

Use this for `input[name="slug"]`, `#payment-amount-field`, and other React-controlled inputs that ignore standard automation.

### Duration-specific note
- For standard durations, use the built-in options (`30 min`, `1 hr`)
- For custom durations, choose `Custom`, then set `input[name="customEventDuration"]` plus `name="customEventDurationType"`
- Calendly may normalize saved output, so a custom duration can later display as `3 hr`

## Recommended Live Workflow for {{PARENT_1}}'s Consulting Tiers

### Quick Consult
- One-on-one
- `30 min`
- Zoom
- slug: `quick-consult`
- payment: `$500`

### Deep Dive
- One-on-one
- `1 hr`
- Zoom
- slug: `deep-dive`
- payment: `$900`

### Strategy Session
- One-on-one
- `3 hr`
- Zoom
- slug: `strategy-session`
- payment: `$2500`
- Fastest creation path: duplicate Deep Dive, then edit duration/slug/payment and turn it on

## Common Agent Operations

### Verify auth
1. `GET /users/me`
2. Store user URI and organization URI
3. If org-level work is needed, fetch org memberships

### Create a new consulting event type
1. API `POST /event_types` to create the shell when possible
2. Open the event in Playwright
3. Use `More options` for slug, invitee form, booking page, payment
4. Turn on the event if needed
5. Verify `Copy link` on the Scheduling card
6. Open the live page before announcing success

### Check bookings
1. `GET /scheduled_events?user=...`
2. For attendee detail, call invitee endpoints from the webhook/event URIs
3. Use webhooks instead of polling whenever possible

### Manage availability
1. `GET /user_availability_schedules`
2. Use the Availability UI when schedule editing is required
3. Cross-check conflict calendars in `Calendar settings`

### Configure paid consult links
1. Confirm Stripe connection
2. Ensure event exists
3. Open editor → `More options` → `Payment`
4. Set amount and verify the summary/public price
5. Confirm the Scheduling card exposes `Copy link`
6. Share the public URL only after that check passes

### Hook Calendly into {{PERSONAL_DOMAIN}}
1. Create/verify event types in Calendly
2. Register webhook on a Vercel endpoint
3. On `invitee.created`, create/update CRM/task/lead state
4. On `invitee.canceled`, update state and handle reschedule logic
5. Keep payment truth in Stripe; keep booking truth in Calendly

## Guardrails

- Prefer **API** for reads, syncing, and supported event CRUD
- Prefer **Playwright/UI** for payment configuration and advanced booking-page edits
- Verify plan-gated areas like Routing and Advanced settings live before depending on them
- Do not assume every editor option is exposed in REST v2
- For a small number of paid links, UI automation is usually faster than over-building API abstractions too early
- Never announce a booking link as live until the Scheduling card shows `Copy link` and the public page loads
