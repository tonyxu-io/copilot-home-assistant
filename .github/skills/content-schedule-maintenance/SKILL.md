# Content Schedule Maintenance Skill

Canonical scheduling rules and maintenance workflow for a multi-platform content queue. This skill is the source of truth for ordering logic, collision detection, and queue optimization.

## The 5 Ordering Rules (Priority Order)

### Rule 1 — No Collisions (CRITICAL — fix first)
Two posts at the exact same datetime on the same platform = collision. One will fail to publish.
- **Detection:** Group posts by platform + datetime. Any group with 2+ posts = collision.
- **Fix:** Move one post to the next available slot (same platform, same day, 2+ hours later).

### Rule 2 — Platform Cascade (HIGHEST scheduling priority)
Long-form MUST publish BEFORE short-form teasers for the same topic.
```
YouTube long-form → YouTube Medium → LinkedIn long → TikTok short → Instagram Reel → X tweet → YouTube Short
```
- **Why:** Short-form clips tease the long-form. Publishing teasers first spoils content and loses the promotional funnel.
- **Detection:** For each topic cluster, check if any short-form posts are scheduled before the long-form.
- **Fix:** Swap so long-form goes first.

### Rule 3 — Topic Clustering (HIGH priority)
Posts from the same topic should schedule within a **24-48h window** of each other.
- **Why:** Content has a freshness window. Cross-platform flywheel works best when clustered.
- **Detection:** Group posts by topic. If any post is >48h from its siblings, flag it.
- **Fix:** Move outliers closer to the cluster center.

### Rule 4 — Platform Spacing (MEDIUM priority)
Minimum **2-hour gap** between posts on the same platform.
- **Why:** Posting twice within an hour cannibalizes your own reach.
- **Detection:** Sort posts by platform + time. Flag consecutive posts <2h apart.
- **Fix:** Push the later post forward to maintain 2h+ spacing.

### Rule 5 — Topic Diversity (LOW priority)
Don't put 5+ posts about the same topic in a row across platforms.
- **Why:** Multi-platform followers get spammed.
- **Detection:** Check chronological sequence. 5+ consecutive same-topic = violation.
- **Fix:** Interleave with other content.

## "Same Topic" Matching

Posts are considered "same topic" if ANY match:
- Same **tags** (e.g., `mythos`, `copilot-remote`)
- Same key phrases in title/content (fuzzy: 2+ shared significant words)
- Same **GitHub Issue** origin (tag like `idea-207`)
- Same **media** (same video URL across platforms)

## Bundle Scheduling (Video Production Bundles)

When content-editor produces a multi-platform release:

### Cascade Timing (within a bundle)
1. YouTube (long-form anchor) publishes FIRST
2. LinkedIn (thought leadership) within 1-2 hours after
3. Twitter/X (teaser) within 2-4 hours after YouTube
4. TikTok + Instagram (short-form) within 4-8 hours after YouTube

### Bundle Rules
- Same-day preference — all bundle posts on the same day when possible
- No self-collision — bundle posts never share a timeslot on the same platform
- Topic clustering — if other posts on the same topic exist, cluster nearby (not same day)
- Blog companion — when blog goes live, add URL in comments/replies (future enhancement)

### Bundle Metadata
```json
{
  "bundle_id": "video-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN",
  "topic": "primary angle",
  "post_ids": ["id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"],
  "platforms": ["youtube", "linkedin", "twitter", "tiktok", "instagram"],
  "cascade_order": ["youtube", "linkedin", "twitter", "tiktok", "instagram"],
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

## Near-Term Maintenance Pass (Every Cycle)

Scans the next 7 days. Fast and lightweight.

### Steps
1. Compute current time (PowerShell — mandatory)
2. Fetch near-term posts via `late_list_posts` with pagination (page 50 = nearest)
3. Build working list: `[{post_id, platform, scheduled_for, title/content_preview, queue_id, content_type}]`
4. Classify content type (long-form / medium / short-form) by queue ID
5. Evaluate all 5 rules against the working list
6. Identify top fixes (max 6 per cycle) — prioritize by rule priority
7. Execute fixes via `late_reschedule_post`
8. Log results

### Scope Limits
- Max 6 swaps per near-term pass
- Never touch posts scheduled within 30 minutes of now
- If no violations: log "✅ Near-term clean — no changes needed."

## Deep Queue Scan (Every 3rd Cycle)

Scans the ENTIRE queue. Runs ~hourly. Track `deep_scan_cycle_count` in memory.

### Purpose
Finds content buried too far out, split topic clusters, and empty near-term slots that could be filled.

### Steps
1. Paginate through ALL scheduled posts (all pages, all platforms)
2. Identify bring-forward candidates (posts 3+ months out that could fill near-term gaps)
3. Identify split topic clusters (same topic scattered across months)
4. Identify orphaned content (posts with no topic siblings on other platforms)
5. Score and select top 3-5 fixes (max 5 swaps per deep scan)
6. Execute bring-forward swaps respecting cascade ordering
7. Log results

### Scoring (highest priority first)
1. Split clusters where half are this week, half are months out
2. High-quality content buried 6+ months with open near-term slots
3. Content buried 3-6 months with open near-term slots
4. Orphaned posts needing consolidation
5. Entirely buried topic clusters that could come forward as a unit

## Weekly Lineup Briefing (Monday Mornings)

### Format
```
📋 <b>This Week's Content Lineup</b>

<b>🎬 Cluster 1: [Topic Name]</b>
  📺 YouTube (long-form) — Mon 8:00 AM
  📱 TikTok (short) — Mon 12:30 PM
  📸 Instagram (reel) — Mon 3:30 PM
  💼 LinkedIn (text) — Tue 12:00 PM

<b>🎬 Cluster 2: [Topic Name]</b>
  ...

<b>⚡ Unclustered / Standalone:</b>
  ...

<b>📊 Totals:</b> X posts across Y platforms
<b>⚠️ Issues:</b> [collisions, ordering violations, etc.]
```

## On-Demand Prioritization

When the operator requests "prioritize [topic]":
1. Search ALL scheduled posts for the topic (all pages)
2. Identify buried posts
3. Find available near-term slots
4. Execute date-swaps (long-form first per cascade)
5. Report what was moved
6. Flag duplicates or missing platforms

## Tools

### Primary
- `late_list_posts` — Fetch scheduled posts (pagination only — date filters broken, return 500)
- `late_reschedule_post` — Move a post to a new datetime (always use `timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"`)
- `late_get_post` — Full post details

### Known API Quirks
- `late_get_queue` returns HTTP 403 — use `late_list_posts` with pagination instead
- `late_list_posts` with `date_from`/`date_to` returns HTTP 500 — date filters broken
- `late_list_posts` sorts descending by `scheduledFor` — page 50 = nearest, page 1 = farthest
- API intermittently returns 500 on PUT operations — log and retry next cycle

### Notification Rules (When to Telegram operator)
Only notify the operator if:
- Fixed a collision (publishing would have broken)
- Made 4+ swaps in one cycle
- Deep scan brought forward 3+ posts
- Found a problem that can't be fixed autonomously
- Same violation recurring 3+ consecutive cycles

## Anti-Patterns
- ❌ Deleting posts (ZERO deletion authority — permanent rule)
- ❌ Touching posts within 30 minutes of publishing
- ❌ Trying to fix everything in one cycle (iterative — top issues only)
- ❌ Running deep scan every cycle (only every 3rd — ~hourly)
- ❌ Notifying the operator for routine maintenance (silent by default)
- ❌ Creating new posts (that's content-manager's domain)
